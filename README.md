# Specter Chatbot
This is a small flask app which uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that is specifically instructed to answer questions and help with issues related to the Bitcoin wallet Specter Desktop. 

So far, there has been no fine-tuning of a Specter specific model. Only Specter-specific instructions were given.

To run it yourself, you need to create a environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` and set to your OpenAI API token.
